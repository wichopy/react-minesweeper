# React Minesweeper

An implementation of Minesweeper using React's flux architecture.

Explored using immer.js for immutability and applying Breadth First Search in the minesweeper board update logic.

### TODO:
- Compare with an OO implementation to store the application logic.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
